against
them
by
settler

protesting
in
our
neighbourhood
when
the
police
arrived
and
beat
us
i
was
injured
in
my
head
they
dont

they
target

said
palestinian
writer
mohammed
elkurd
from
sheikh
jarrah
posted
on
twitter
a
video
and
photos
on

showing
israeli
police
spraying
streets
with

intense
chemically
manipulated
liquid
that
sticks
on
your
skin
for
a
week
if
it
came
in
direct
contact
israeli
ngo
ir
amim
said
in
a
wednesday
statement
for
about
two
weeks
israeli
police
cordoned
off
the
kerem
alajoni
section
or
the
eastern
part
of
sheikh
jarrah
where
hundreds
of
palestinians
under
threat
of
forced
expulsion
live
a
heavy
presence
of
police
and
paramilitary
forces
blocks
access
to
the
area
it
said
since
may
the
closure
has
intensified
with
entry
of
supporters
of
palestinian
residents
banned
because
of
the
socalled
risk
of
clashes
but
these
restrictions
are
not
imposed
on
supporters
of
jewish
settlers
living
there
ir
amim
said
the
closure
of
the
neighbourhood
is
seen
as
an
intentional
brazen
move
by
the
israeli
authorities
to
suppress
palestinian
mobilisation
and
deprive
the
residents
of
sheikh
jarrah
of
the
freedom
of
expression
and
the
right
to
protest
against
their
forced
displacement
it
said
palestinian
families
are
living
inside
a
cordonedoff
militarylike
zone
they
are
subject
to
ongoing
arbitrary
harassment
and
aggressive
police
measures
marked
by
forced
entry
into
homes
and
the
use
of
stun
grenades
skunk
water
and
rubbertipped
bullets
against
neighbourhood
residents
police
often
force
residents
to
stay
in
their
homes
and
hostilely
remove
those
sitting
outside
ir
amim
said
adding
a
soldier
fired
rubbertipped
rounds
into
a
familys
house
on
tuesday
severely
wounding
a
yearold
girl
inside
the
ngo
said
it
sent
an
urgent
letter
to
the
police
last
week
demanding
they
lift
the
neighbourhoods
closure
and
stop
the
hostile
measures
which
lead
to
further
incitement
but
no
response
has
been
received
yet
palestinian
resident
carmel
qasem
told
al
jazeera
police
told
his
family
if
they
left
the
neighbourhood
they
would
not
be
allowed
to
return
their
biggest
concern
is
the
checkpoint
will
become
permanent
at
the
entrance
to
the
neighbourhood
and
police
will
keep
conducting
security
checks
on
residents
they
come
to
check
our
ids
and
addresses
even
when
were
standing
by
our
own
house
in
the
neighbourhood
qasem
said
while
families
await
the
court
ruling
iskafi
said
their
current
concern
is
with
farright
extremists
entering
the
neighbourhood
with
the
support
of
member
of
knesset
itamar
bengvir
and
jerusalem
deputy
mayor
aryeh
king
as
long
as
they
are
still
coming
to
the
neighbourhood
the
tension
will
continue
iskafi
said
israeli
media
reported
last
week
police
chief
kobi
shabtai
told
prime
minister
benjamin
netanyahu
that
bengvir
was
responsible
for
adding
fuel
to
the
fire
in
occupied
east
jerusalem
as
well
as
in
mixed
cities
in
israel
proper
that
saw

omar
alkiswani
director
of
the
holy
mosque
told
al

that
alaqsa
has
sustained
damage
amounting
to

to
excessive
force
used
by
israeli
forces
during
their
violent
raids
in
the
compound
